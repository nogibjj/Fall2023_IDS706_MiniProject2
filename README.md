# Fall2023_IDS706 Mini Project 2
### Purpose
This is for class data engineering mini-project 2. It uses a Python GitHub template with pandas to run and test a function that provides summary statistics for a data frame.

### Steps
Based on the template, I made the following changes:
1. Added Python in requirements.txt
2. Modified the function in main.py to read the CSV file, store and return the summary statistics table, create a plot.
3. Added test cases in test_main.py

### Check format and test errors:
In codespace, I run command make test, make format, and make lint. The commands run smoothly.
