# Fall2023_IDS706
This is for class data engineering mini project 2. It uses a Python GitHub template with pandas to run and test a function that provides summary statistics for a dataframe.
Based on the template, I added python in requirements.txt, modified the function in main.py to read the csv file and return the statistics, and added test cases in test_main.py.
