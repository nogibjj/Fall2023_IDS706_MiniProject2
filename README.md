# Fall2023_IDS706 Mini Project 2
### Project
This is for class data engineering mini-project 2. It uses a Python GitHub template with pandas to run and test a function that provides summary statistics for a data frame.

### Steps
Based on the template, I made the following changes:
1. Added Python in requirements.txt
2. Modified the function in main.py to read the CSV file and return the statistics
3. Added test cases in test_main.py
